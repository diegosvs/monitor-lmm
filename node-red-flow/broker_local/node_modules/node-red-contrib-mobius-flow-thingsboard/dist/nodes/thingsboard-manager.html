  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    This node has two purposes, provisioning (creating) devices and assets in Thingsboard from Mobius Objects, and maintaining a list of registered
    Mobius Objects that can update their attributes and telemetry in Thingsboard. The reason for maintaining a list of registered objects is 
    to prevent devices being created in Thingsboard automatically when sending telemetry data.
  </p>
  <p>
    When devices or assets are provisioned in Thingsboard using this node that will have their device type set to the Mobius Object's profile name and 
    their client attributes and telemetry values set based on the Mobius Object's resources. It is recommended that you set the <b>name</b> resource 
    to something other than the default for all Mobius Objects prior to provisioning as this resource will be used as the device name in Thingsboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Provisioning devices will also register them so you do not need to register devices after provisioning them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Registration of devices does not persist between restarts of the flows. You must send a <b>register-objects</b> message with an array 
    of all objects to be registered on every start of the flows.
  </p>

  <h3>Input Message Payload</h3>
  <p>Both the <code>register-objects</code> and <code>provision-devices</code> messages require the message payload to be an array of Mobius Objects.</p>
  <p>It is recommended that you preceed this node with a Mobius <code>discover object list</code> node with the output set to MOBiUS Objects as an array of items. 
    This will provide the input in the correct format.
